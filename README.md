## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
A service for pay in which the employees could have an account and communicate their schedule including swapping days if allowed by the manager. The owner would be able to see the schedule at all times, including late or missed work days from employees. Amongst other data. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Clover is lacking in revenue from services compared to the competition because the offer many things for free. Not only that but they let the client shop for credit card processors. This plays into their target market being slightly more established restaurants that save on credit card fees when they shop around. In fact it is very important to these restaurants. 
Clover needs to innovate further to separate themselves from the competition as their big selling points are too nuanced for most potential clients to care for. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
It would require an application on the servers phones along with an admin to approve of changes. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
